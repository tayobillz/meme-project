# 😂 Meme Poster Project

This is a simple HTML and CSS meme-style project. It displays a poster with an image, a bold title, and a funny caption — styled to look like a classic meme.

## 🖼️ What It Looks Like

- A black background with a centered white-bordered image
- Big, bold heading ("THAT SPECIAL NIGHT")
- A short caption underneath
- Styled with Google Fonts and clean layout using CSS

## 💻 What I Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- Google Fonts (`Libre Baskerville`)
